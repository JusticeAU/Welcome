.Game Mechanics.
This is a Console game.
Your game will include 2 teams of 3 characters.
At the start of the game, each character shall be given a 
weapons to equip for battle.
Each player may provide a name for each character on their team.
Starting defence and hitpoints for all characters can be the same.

Team 1 will attack first, followed by Team 2.
If a character's health drops to or below 0, they are eliminated from
the battle and will no longer be given a chance to attack. A character's
elimination shall be anounced.
Once all characters on a team are eliminated, a winner shall be declared.

Each character from a team will perform an attack before the other team
gets their turn.
You will choose a character on the opposing team to attack by
typing a number between 1 and 3.
If your chosen character to attack has already been eliminated, or if an 
invalid choice is given, the player must choose a different character to 
attack.

.Challenges.
Add a recoveryTurns stat to each weapon that controls how many 
turns a character has to wait after attacking with their weapon.
Add a speed stat to each character that will affect the order 
in which characters attack within a team.
Add the ability for the speed stat to also impact turn order 
across teams (Characters from any team can attack in any order based
on their stats).
